# Design Diary

[ struggle you overcame ]

My biggest problems with this project related to the translation of the data the application handles into the web pages it displays. I felt relatively comfortable with writing the parts of the code that process the data in the background, but I'm not particularly well-versed in the web-specific parts of this kind of project, like HTML, CSS, or Javascript, which I think is a big part of why those parts of my code tennded to turn out rather ugly, and in retrospect I felt that I didn't make use of the tools that Flask provides for this, like templates, to as great an extent that I should have.

To a future student working on this assignment, I would recommend starting any research on Flask-specific issues by going to the Flask documentation for the function or feature in question. Even when referencing the documentation didn't immediately clear up my confusion, it made it easier to understand the solutions I did find elsewhere.
